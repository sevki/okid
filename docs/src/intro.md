# 👌🫆 okid

`okid` is a library for generating double clickable representations of various types of data,
such as `sha1` hashes, `uuid`s and more.

## sha1
```rust
use sha1::Digest as sha1digest;
let hasher = sha1::Sha1::new();
let binary_id = okid::OkId::from(hasher);
```
## sha256
```rust
use sha2::Digest;
let mut hasher = sha2::Sha256::new();
hasher.update(b"hello world");
let binary_id = okid::OkId::from(hasher);
```

The resulting strings look like this:
`2ː00b94d27b9934d3e08a52e52d7da7dabfac484efe37a5380ee9088f7ace2efcde9`
first character of the string is the type of the binary data
in this case 2 means sha256
the rest of the string is the hexadecimal representation of the binary data
